# Requirement

The application should provide users with the ability to connect their cryptocurrency wallet, displaying their wallet connection status and address with an option to disconnect when needed.

Users should be able to perform ETH transfers by entering recipient addresses and specifying the amount to send, with proper validation before transaction execution. 

The system needs to maintain a transaction history showing past transfers, including details such as transaction hashes, sender and recipient addresses, transferred amounts, status, and timestamps. 

The interface should provide clear feedback during all operations, implement loading states while transactions are processing, and handle errors appropriately. The design should be responsive, working seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices.
